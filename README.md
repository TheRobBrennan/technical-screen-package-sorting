## The Challenge

I've included the requirements from the challenge for reference.

### Objective

Imagine you work in a robotic automation factory, and your objective is to write a function for one of its robotic arms that will dispatch the packages to the correct stack according to their volume and mass.

### Rules

Sort the packages using the following criteria:

- A package is **bulky** if its volume (Width x Height x Length) is greater than or equal to 1,000,000 cmÂ³ or when one of its dimensions is greater or equal to 150 cm.
- A package is **heavy** when its mass is greater or equal to 20 kg.

You must dispatch the packages in the following stacks:

- **STANDARD**: standard packages (those that are not bulky or heavy) can be handled normally.
- **SPECIAL**: packages that are either heavy or bulky can't be handled automatically.
- **REJECTED**: packages that are **both** heavy and bulky are rejected.

### Implementation

Implement the function **`sort(width, height, length, mass)`** (units are centimeters for the dimensions and kilogram for the mass). This function must return a string: the name of the stack where the package should go.

## My solution

For this particular example, I wanted to demonstrate how I would solve this challenge - creating two solutions to demonstrate my style and approach with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and [Python](https://www.python.org). ðŸ¤“

TL;DR

If you already have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), `npm`, and [Python](https://www.python.org) installed on your system, you can run the following scripts to see my solutions in action ðŸ¤“

```sh
# Pull the trigger and run both TypeScript and Python solutions
% npm start

# TypeScript solution
% npm run typescript:solution

# Python solution
% npm run python:solution

```

### TypeScript

To run the TypeScript solution from the project root:

```sh
# TypeScript solution
% npm run typescript:solution

```

```sh
# Navigate to the directory
% cd solutions/typescript

# Install dependencies
% npm install

# Run scripts as desired ðŸ¤“

## EXAMPLE: Run tests
% npm test

## EXAMPLE: Run tests and generate a code coverage report
% npm run test:coverage

## EXAMPLE: Run tests with verbose output
% npm run test:verbose

## EXAMPLE: Run tests with verbose output and generate a code coverage report
% npm run test:verbose:coverage

## EXAMPLE: Run code in development
% npm start

## EXAMPLE: Build project
% npm run build

## EXAMPLE: Run production code after building the project
% npm run start:prod

```

### Python

To run the Python solution from the project root:

```sh
# Python solution
% npm run python:solution

```

```sh
# Navigate to the directory
% cd solutions/python

# Initialize the Python virtual environment
% python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the Python virtual environment
# On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
% source .venv/bin/activate

# Install the packages from requirements.txt
(.venv) % pip install -r requirements.txt

# To run the code:
(.venv) % python3 src/main.py

# To run tests:
(.venv) % pytest

# To run tests and automatically view the HTML coverage report on macOS:
(.venv) % pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html && open htmlcov/index.html

# To run tests with verbose output:
(.venv) % pytest -v

# To run tests with verbose output and automatically view the HTML coverage report on macOS:
(.venv) % pytest -v --cov=. --cov-report=html && open htmlcov/index.html

# To run a single unit test
(.venv) % pytest tests/lib/test_sort.py

# Deactivate your virtual environment
(.venv) % deactivate

```
